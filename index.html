        <p class="right-article">
          SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Wednesday that it was
          suffering its worst drought in 37 years, adding to a food crisis that
          the United Nations said would worsen in coming months without urgent
          outside aid. The country has received just 2.1 inches of rain this
          year, or 42.3 percent of the average, the North’s official Korean
          Central News Agency said, adding that it was the lowest level since
          1982. The news agency said weather conditions for heavy rain were not
          expected until the end of this month. The report followed a joint
          announcement from two United Nations relief agencies this month that
          about 10 million North Koreans, or 40 percent of the population, were
          facing “severe food shortages” after the country had its worst harvest
          in a decade last fall. The two groups, the World Food Program and the
          Food and Agriculture Organization, warned that North Korea’s early
          season crops like wheat and barley, which will be harvested next
          month, were likely to suffer from “widespread low rainfall and lack of
          snow cover, which left crops exposed to freezing temperatures during
          winter.” In recent weeks, the North’s news media has reported that
          party officials and workers were in an “all-out struggle” to find new
          water sources and mobilize pumps and irrigation equipment to save the
          crops. United Nations sanctions imposed since the North’s fourth
          nuclear test in 2016 have sharply reduced the country’s exports,
          raising questions about how much foreign currency reserves it has to
          finance food imports, and North Korea remains in a standoff with
          Washington over its nuclear weapons program. North Korea’s leader, Kim
          Jong-un, has been hoping to win relief from the sanctions in return
          for the partial dismantlement of his country’s nuclear weapons
          facilities. In February, he met for the second time with President
          Trump, but talks in Vietnam collapsed after Mr. Trump refused to lift
          sanctions until North Korea relinquished all its nuclear weapons. A
          famine in the 1990s resulted in the deaths of two million people,
          according to some estimates. Although the situation has since
          improved, the country has had chronic food shortages. But the
          situation turned worse again in the past year, and in February, North
          Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, issued an unusual
          appeal for urgent food aid. United Nations relief agencies have
          appealed annually for donations to help alleviate widespread
          malnutrition among children and nursing mothers in North Korea. But
          they have dwindled in recent years as the North has financed its
          nuclear weapons program with resources Washington said should have
          been used to feed its people. North Korea’s state propaganda tells
          citizens that their economic difficulties are caused by international
          sanctions that Americans have created to “strangle” their country.
          After the latest talks with Washington broke down, North Korea vowed
          not to buckle to international pressure even if its people had to
          survive on “water and air only,” state media said. Mr. Kim said
          Washington had until the end of the year to show more flexibility or
          his country would seek an alternative to diplomatic negotiations. In
          the past week, North Korea has resumed short-range missile tests and,
          analysts say, may launch longer-range missiles if Washington does not
          ease sanctions. South Korea is seeking to provide humanitarian food
          aid to North Korea as a good-will gesture that it hopes will help the
          North refrain from weapons tests and return to the negotiating table.
          Mr. Trump supports South Korea’s efforts to provide aid, according to
          the office of President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. United Nations
          sanctions against North Korea do not ban humanitarian aid for the
          country. But after North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan
          in 2017, South Korea faced pressure to reconsider its plan to donate
          $8 million to the World Food Program and United Nations Children’s
          Fund to help North Korea’s malnourished children and pregnant women.
          The sanctions have banned the export of coal, iron ore and other key
          North Korean products, as well as drastically cut oil imports. They
          have deprived the regime of important sources of income, as well as
          undercut its ability to import food to alleviate chronic food
          shortages. Since the famine in the 1990s, millions of North Koreans
          have learned to fend for themselves by securing their own food through
          unofficial markets. But millions of others still depend on the ration
          system, including soldiers and workers in state-run factories. Tho
          latter group, including the elites, are believed to suffer more from
          international sanctions than those dependent on market activities.
